        <p class="section-header">How Twitter Talks About COVID-19</p>
        <p class="section-body">
            In 2020, with everyone from high schoolers to the President of the United States getting and 
            sharing news on Twitter, the platform has become a way to tap into the pulse of current events 
            and discourse.<br><br>
            For this project, I used data from The Panacea Lab recording the top used terms and n-grams used 
            every day since March in tweets related to COVID-19. I also scraped the data of all tweets that 
            outgoing U.S. President Donald Trump has posted in 2020. I processed all this data with custom 
            Python scripts in a number of ways to glean various forms of analysis from the underlying data. 
            <br><br>
            The following are three visualizations highlighting trends in the data and providing the user the 
            opportunity to explore and interact with the data through graphic elements.

        <p class="section-header">Visualization 1</p>
        <p class="section-body">Every day since the outbreak began at the beginning of 2020 thousands of tweets 
            have been posted regarding COVID-19. The Panacea Lab data has analyzed and compiled 
            the daily data to find the top n-grams (combinations of “n” terms) that appear in 
            these tweets, and gathering the most popular terms of each day as well as 
            holistically since the virus began.<br><br>

            Below is an interactive and customizable visualization of the top n-grams (in total, 
            from March to November) appearing in these analyzed tweets. You can use the radio 
            buttons below to choose the “n”, allowing the selection of combinations of either 1, 2, 
            or 3 words. Note the update of the visualization depending on the selection.  You can 
            also use the slider to adjust the preferred top # of terms to be displayed in the visualization,
            allowing the user to get a better sense of how certain terms related to similarly-frequent terms 
            as well as much less frequent terms.
            <br><br>
            Each bubble represents one n-gram, with the size corresponding to the frequency, and a 
            label including the total number of its’ appearances. For a real-life example of such a 
            tweet for a given n-gram, simply hover the mouse over its bubble and notice the updated 
            text appearing with the content of such a tweet. 
            <br><br>
            <b>NOTE</b>: For visual conciseness, due to the frequency of the (fairly long) word 
            “coronavirus” in so many of the n-grams, it has been substituted in the multi-term n-grams 
            with a star (★) icon. However, note that you will still see the original tweet appearing 
            from the n-gram selected.</p>

        <p class="section-body">
            Now that we have sifted around through the most frequent terms in summation, 
            let’s dive a bit deeper into the changes/development of certain specific terms 
            throughout our analyzed time window. Below, you will see a time-series graph 
            mapping the frequency of certain words over time since the data collection began. 
            <br><br>
            I have plotted a few common terms to start with to illustrate the concept and be 
            compared against. To explore the data further, enter a search term into the search 
            box and click the button, at which point the term’s trajectory will be plotted for 
            you for comparison against other similar terms. 
            <br><br>
            <b>Note</b>: If your chosen term doesn’t appear as a complete line, it was not consistently
            one of the top 1000 terms used in the tweets we are studying. For an example of a common 
            word, try searching “donald” or “covid”. 
            <br><br>
            For further analysis, this graph has been annotated with significant moments in the 
            timeline of the progression of the coronavirus, so you can note what trends in term 
            usage may have been related to events happening at that time. For instance, you will 
            see a few notable features of the pre-drawn term lines, such as spikes in reference to both 
            the virus and Donald Trump around controversial or otherwise significant instances in the 
            case spread and government response to virus developments, such as immigratino bans or when 
            the President himself was diagnosed. Try plotting a few other terms and explore if they peak or
            dip at times you might expect.

            My apologies, working by myself while also working at my job full time, after I ran into 
            some issues with my original idea for this visualization, I tried to switch to another idea 
            at the somewhat last minute, and didn’t have time to get it annotated and properly interactive. 
            <br><br>
            The goal here was to have a plot tracking the daily/weekly frequency of tweets from Donald 
            Trump (with separate side-by-side or stacked bars to show what percentage of the tweets actually 
            mention or are related to the pandemic). I was going to overlay this with a line chart showing 
            the death toll in the United States, hoping to illustrate the relationship (slash disparity between) 
            his willingness to speak publicly about the virus (and statements about it), particularly early on, 
            with the rate at which it was spreading and killing Americans. 
            <br><br>
            I was going to have it be so that the user could toggle between showing time data for quanitities of tweets 
            that did and did not address the pandemic, and let them click on the bars to pull up examples of 
            actual tweets from the selected bar’s given day/week to compare what his statements about it were on a 
            given day, juxtaposed with the rates of covid death and transmission. 
            <br><br>
            I wrote custom Python scripts to transform and format the data set of his tweets I acquired, and was able 
            to get as far as making this preliminary amount of a bar chart before I ran out of time, my apologies 
            about that. Thanks for scrolling this far!
